Block{
    timestamp
    lasthash
    data
    hash
}

TDD test driven development approach

Next create a genesis block

Now mine block  

Hash the block - SHA256 - 256bits in 64 chaaracter hexadecimal format

Now crate a chain

chain validation
    inspect a blockchain for its correctness
chain replacement
    longer chain - replace chain function
    

POW system 
    add nounce and dificulty to block

Blockchian network
    creating API's in express to read and write data to blockchain

Networking pattern
    Pub/Sub - Broadcast and listen
    redis for channel pub/sub
    Pubnub or redis

    sync all chains

Wallets, keys transactions
    Create test wallet classes
    eliptic curve cryptography for keys
    sign keys

Miner
    1. Grab all the valid transaction in the pool
    2. Genearte a miners reward
    3. Do the CPU work to find a valid hash
    4. Broadcast the updated blockchain
    5. clear the transaction pool
