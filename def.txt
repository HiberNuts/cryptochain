Block{
    timestamp
    lasthash
    data
    hash
}

TDD test driven development approach

Next create a genesis block

Now mine block  

Hash the block - SHA256 - 256bits in 64 chaaracter hexadecimal format

Now crate a chain

chain validation
    inspect a blockchain for its correctness
chain replacement
    longer chain - replace chain function
    

POW system 
    add nounce and dificulty to block

Blockchian network
    creating API's in express to read and write data to blockchain

Networking pattern
    Pub/Sub - Broadcast and listen
    redis for channel pub/sub
    Pubnub or redis

    sync all chains

Wallets, keys transactions
    Create test wallet classes
    eliptic curve cryptography for keys
    sign keys
